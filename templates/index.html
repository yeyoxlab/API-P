		The REST APIs provide programmatic access to read and write Protcloud data. Add new smart meter, delete a smart meter, update a smart meter information, read and write system information, and more. The REST API identifies Protcloud applications and users using JWE; responses are available in JSON.

	<h1>Authentication JWE </h1>

	<p>
		
		JWE represents encrypted content using JSON data structures and base64url encoding. The representation consists of three parts: the JWE Header, the JWE Encrypted Key, and the JWE Ciphertext. The three parts are base64url-encoded for transmission, and typically represented as the concatenation of the encoded strings in that order, with the three strings being separated by period ('.') characters.
	JWE utilizes encryption to ensure the confidentiality of the contents of the Plaintext. JWE does not add a content integrity check if not provided by the underlying encryption algorithm. If such a check is needed, an algorithm providing it such as AES-GCM [NIST 800 38D] can be used, or alternatively, it can be provided through composition by encrypting a representation of the signed content (Jones Michael B., 2011).
	Thanks to the advantages of JWE, PROTCLOUD used JWE-based authentication, which allows interoperability and scalability to new technological needs.
	To obtain a JWT, its necessary login on PROTCLOUD with an app ID and password.
	This can be obtained by registering on the following link <a href="https://protcloud.com/app/v1/Register">https://protcloud.com/app/v1/Register<</a>> 
	After registration of the application, we obtain the following information:
	•	name_app: "name_of_app"
	•	secret_key: "new_secret"
	It will be used to obtain a JWE through a login. 
	 
	The following diagram shows how the API works.
